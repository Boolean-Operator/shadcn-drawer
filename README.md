This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) re-usable component collection.

The drawer uses the sheet component and is hidden until the screen is below 641px (tailwindcss small break point).
